# Hornets Nest

Use VBA to replace every instance of "Hornets" in the 6x7 grid with "Bugs" or "Bees" based off of the available amound of these.
Create buttons for the following: 
  * Randomly reset the grid with Hornets, Bugs, and Bees. Randomly reset the available number of Bugs and Bees.
  * Reset the grid with the orignal layout of Hornets, Bugs, and Bees. Reset the available number of Bugs and Bees to the original amount.
  * Randomly reset the available number of Bugs and Bees only.
  * Run the Removal Script.

## Instructions

* Create a VBA script to handle the growing hornet infestation in your spreadsheet.

* Use nested for loops to find all of the Hornets in the "nest" and replace them with Bugs or Bees. For each instance of Hornets, if there are both bugs and bees remaining, randomly place bugs or bees with equal probability and adjust the amount of that insect remaining.

* If there is only 1 type of insect remaining, use that kind.

* If there are no insects remaining, stop the loop and show a message saying, "Oh no! We still have hornets."

* Create buttons for the following: 
  * Randomly reset the grid with Hornets, Bugs, and Bees. Randomly reset the available number of Bugs and Bees.
  * Reset the grid with the orignal layout of Hornets, Bugs, and Bees. Reset the available number of Bugs and Bees to the original amount.
  * Randomly reset the available number of Bugs and Bees only.
  * Run the Removal Script.
